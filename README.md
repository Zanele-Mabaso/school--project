## About Me

I'm Zanele, a student on a mission to become one of the best programmers out there.  
I’m passionate about using tech to solve real-life problems and make a difference.  
Right now, I’m focused on learning everything I can — from software engineering to AI.  
One day, I hope to build my own system, app, and even a *programming language* that helps people and changes lives.
